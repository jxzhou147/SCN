First, calculate and show the phase distribution of oscillators.
Then show the synchronization and robustness effect of rewiring, with parameters well selected. How to define the entrainment time ?
Next, calculate the PRC, IRC, entrainment time and entrainment range for oscillators under both rewiring and no rewiring cases
For each step, the rewiring rate and difference between ventral and dorsal SCN need considering.

# the entrainment is not needed when not considering the effect of rewiring on seasonal clock. 

Finally, try to find a physical picture of rewiring. Try to find a analytic explanation of kuramoto model.

problem: the ventral SCN can not entrainment the dorsal SCN.
change the network

# Before comparation, checking the reliability of the network: under DD, the effect of TTX , etc

Objective:
1. synchronization better: R
2. synchronization faster
3. resynchronization faster(jet-lag)

parameters: d, p_link, K, p_re, t_re
